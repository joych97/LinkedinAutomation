# LinkedinAutomation
Automating the withdraw/accept connection request flows.

As we know Linkedin does not have any way by which we can accept/reject or withdraw multiple connection requests at once. So I have created 3 different scripts to automate this process.

Steps to use:
1. Just open your Linkedin account and click to the My Network button and navigate to the proper tab i.e either the sent connection request page or the pending connection request page.
2. Once you are done with the above step just copy the content of the script paste it on the dev console and hit enter. That's it you will now be able to see the request getting accepted/rejected



You can use the ```automateLinkedinWithdraw``` script to withdraw all the sent connection requests.

You can use the ```automateLinkedinAccept``` script to accept all the pending connection requests. 

You can use the ```automateLinkedinIgnore``` script to reject all the pending connection requests.
